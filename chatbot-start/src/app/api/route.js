	This code shows a naive approach of persisting user session data
	in a cookie. In a production-grade app, you'll probably want to use authentication tokens instead. 

	For example, the firebase-admin/auth package offers a `getAuth().verifyIdToken(token)` method for server side code. The `token` can be sent from the client and stored in a cookie.
